# PySpark_Lessons
____
My first experience with PySpark - exploring the data and making simple ETL Pipeline.

For this project [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lepchenkov/usedcarscatalog) data is used. The dataset is collected from various web resources in order to explore the used cars market and try to build a model that effectively predicts the price of the car based on its parameters (both numerical and categorical).
